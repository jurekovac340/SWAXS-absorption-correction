# 3D Absorption Correction for X-ray Scattering in Cylindrical Capillaries  This repository contains the Python code used to perform 3D absorption corrections for small-angle / wide-angle X-ray scattering measured in cylindrical capillaries. The method explicitly integrates the beam intensity distribution and attenuation through the capillary.
